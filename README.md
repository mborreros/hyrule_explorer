# Hyrule Explorer

## Description

This web app acts as a companion to the Zelda: Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch game. Other web and mobile apps like Hyrule Companion offer great features to track your progress on maps and help you through challenges, but do not allow you to document notes or information that happen along the way. Hyrule Explorer does just that. With the help of this web app, you can explore Hyrule Kingdom, battle enemies and grow your weapon collection all while documenting your experience. 

## To run web app

Clone this repository in your local environment. Run npm install to install dependencies. If you do not have npm set up on your computer, go online and download it (you might need to download node.js as well, so beware!). Then run npm start and you have access to the web app. Please be aware this web app utilizes a local server to permit all functionality, so some of forms and home page elements will not completely load.
